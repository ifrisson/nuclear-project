# Project Nuclear #

Project **Nuclear** seeks to create a set of high quality samplers, synthesizers and effects on the GNU/Linux platform and facilitate tools for their development. To do so we maintain our own developer friendly SDK to make the job fun again.

The **Nuclear SDK** will be in the form of header-only libraries, similar to Boost, with no need for their own compilation. Just include them in your code and take advantage of the functions they offer.

Project Nuclear always welcome new DSP wizards, graphic designer elves and developer orchs to join our cause and start develop synthesizers and effects as part of the project. But you are just as welcome if all you want is to deploy our SDK in your own project.

Google Code host our developer documentation wiki, subversion repository and issue tracker while our [main site](http://projectnuclear.org) contains information about our community and plugins.

## Why “Nuclear?” ##

At first, the name was meant to be poking fun at Native Instrument’s Reaktor, calling it Nuklear at the time. Failing to come up with any better name, we decided to stick with Nuclear, going with the English spelling to hopefully avoid any trademark trouble. The “Project” part got tacked on because there was already a project called “Nuclear” out there on SourceForge.

## Who is “We?” ##

The Nuclear Project currently consists of Anders Dahnielson, of Sweden, and Darren Landrum, of the United States.
