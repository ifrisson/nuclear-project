The purpose of the Nuclear Project is to create an application that can be used to create audio synthesizers, samplers, and effects using a friendly graphical environment. The Nuclear Project is based upon these basic ideas:

1) That control signals be treated just like audio signals, so that DSP can be done to both.

2) The separation of the DSP blocks, the routing layer, and the user interface layer.

3) The composition of simpler DSP functions to create more complex functions and advanced features for the synthesizers and samplers created with Nuclear.

The project will be designed around the idea of using FAUST to create the DSP blocks, though straight C++ can be used where it makes the most sense.
