== Introduction ==

A digital filter is a system that performs mathematical operations on a sampling, discrete-time signal to reduce or enhance certain aspects of that signal. A digital filter is characterized by its transfer function. Mathematical analysis of the transfer function can describe how it will respond to any input. As such, designing a filter begins with finding an appropriate transfer function for a particular problem.

After a filter is designed, it is must be realized by developing a signal flow diagram that describes how the filter can be implemented. A given filter can be realized in many ways. The most straightforward approach is direct computation of the difference equation, which is practical for small filters, but inefficient and impractical for more complex designs.

The transfer function for a typical linear digital filter can be expressed as a transform in the Z-domain.

== Finite impulse response ==

FIR filters have fixed-duration impulse responses. The impulse response, the filter's response to a Kronecker delta input, is 'finite' because it settles to zero in a finite number of sample intervals. The impulse response of an Nth order FIR filter lasts for N+1 samples, and then dies to zero.

An FIR filter has a number of useful properties which sometimes make it preferable to an infinite impulse response filter. FIR filters:

  * Are inherently stable. This is due to the fact that all the poles are located at the origin and thus are located within the unit circle.
  * Require no feedback. This means that any rounding errors are not compounded by summed iterations. The same relative error occurs in each calculation.
  * They can be designed to be linear phase, which means the phase change is proportional to the frequency. This is usually desired for phase-sensitive applications, for example crossover filters, and mastering, where transparent filtering is adequate.

Some of the time, the filter specifications refer to the time-domain shape of the input signal the filter is expected to "recognize". The optimum matched filter is to sample that shape and use those samples directly as the coefficients of the filter -- giving the filter an impulse response that is the time-reverse of the expected input signal.

== Infinite impulse response ==

IIR filters have an impulse response function which is non-zero over an infinite length of time. IIR filters have internal feedback and may continue to respond indefinitely.
