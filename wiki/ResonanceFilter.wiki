== Formant Filter ==

 "A formant is a resonance in the voice spectrum. A single formant may thus be modeled using one _biquad_ (second-order filter section). For example, in the vowel /a/ as in 'father,' the first three formant center-frequencies have been measured near 700, 1220, and 2600 Hz, with half-power bandwidths 130, 70, and 160 Hz. 

 In principle, the formant filter sections are in series, as can be found by deriving the transfer function of an acoustic tube. As a consequence, the vocal-tract transfer function is an all-pole filter (provided that the nasal tract is closed off or negligible). As a result, there is no need to specify gains for the formant resonators -- only center-frequency and bandwidth are necessary to specify each formant, leaving only an overall scale factor unspecified in a cascade (series) formant filter bank.

 Numerically, however, it makes more sense to implement disjoint resonances in parallel rather than in series. This is because when one formant filter is resonating, the others will be attenuating, so that to achieve a particular peak-gain at resonance, the resonating filter must overcome all combined attenuations as well as applying its own gain. In fixed-point arithmetic, this can result in large quantization-noise gains, especially for the last resonator in the chain. As a result of these considerations, our example will implement the formant sections in parallel. This means we must find the appropriate biquad numerators so that when added together, the overall transfer-function numerator is a constant. This will be accomplished using the partial fraction expansion." -- [http://ccrma-www.stanford.edu/~jos/filters/Formant_Filtering_Example.html Formant Filtering Example]
