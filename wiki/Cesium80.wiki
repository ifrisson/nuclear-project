#summary Having a go at modeling the linear and non-linear character of the Yamaha CS80, or at least get close...

= Introduction =

It was and continues to be a seminal instrument of the 70s and 80s. The CS series, including the CS80, was Yamaha's second shot at a synthesizer for the mass market after years of making pianos and organs. Their first go, the GX-1, was a USD$80,000 multi-keyboard monster, which you can see in action, helmed by Keith Emerson, in this [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OLWgrr671g Youtube video].

Eventually, the technology of the GX-1 trickled down into the CS80, which was 8-note polyphonic, fully analog, and cost about USD$8,000, brand new. Still pricey, but within the reach of many electronic artists of the day. Unfortunately, the release of the Sequential Circuits Prophet-5, at a mere $2,500, means the CS80 didn't do too well in the end, but it still found itself in the hands of Toto, Vangelis (who swore by it), and the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OWMGAiaNeQ BBC Radiophonics Workshop].

Unfortunately, this document is not yet going to be the be-all-end-all of modeling this synth. The intent of this page is to "get the ball rolling", so to speak, and to serve as a repository on research for Nuclear, as well as to remind us of what kind of goals we're trying to achieve.

= The Inspiration =

Other than the original CS80, there is a software synth that made me believe this was a possible project. It is _not_ the Arturia CS80V. It is, instead, an inexpensive VSTi plug-in made by one man: the [http://www.stillwellaudio.com/?page_id=37 Olga], by Schwa. Just take a listen to the mp3 samples and you'll hear what I mean.

= Research =

[http://antti.smartelectronix.com/ Antti], of Smartelectronix, has a [http://dafx04.na.infn.it/WebProc/Proc/P_061.pdf paper] available on modeling the non-linear character of the Moog filter. While this is not quite what we're after for the CS80, we can learn something from his approach.

= Considerations =

All electronic circuits have non-linear behaviors, which result in forms of distortion. One of the goals of the electronic designer is to maximize the linear range of his design, and make sure that the device operates within those linear ranges as much as possible. Another goal is to make sure that when a device does get driven beyond its linear range, it does so "gracefully" (ie, with as little intermodulation distortion as possible). There are exceptions to these goals, of course, guitar amps being a famous example. A lot of tube mic preamps are also designed to be driven a little into their non-linear ranges for the purpose of adding "warmth" to a signal.

Nevertheless, a lot of electronic devices, such as the CS80, have non-linear effects that are very pleasing to the ear. Whether the designers intended this or not is moot. Sound designers quickly learned how to take advantage of these effects to create sounds with a lot of character.

The point here is that it's not just the _filters_ that will exhibit these distortions, but _all_ of the circuits that make up a synthesizer. A good approach at this point, then, would be to look at the signal path of the CS80, break it up into its different block sections, then decide how to handle the design of each section to take into account both its function and its distortions.
