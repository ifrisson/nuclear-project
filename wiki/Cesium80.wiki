It was and continues to be a seminal instrument of the 70s and 80s. The CS series, including the CS80, was Yamaha's second shot at a synthesizer for the mass market after years of making pianos and organs. Their first go, the GX-1, was a USD$80,000 multi-keyboard monster, which you can see in action, helmed by Keith Emerson, in this [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OLWgrr671g Youtube video].

Eventually, the technology of the GX-1 trickled down into the CS80, which was 8-note polyphonic, fully analog, and cost about USD$8,000, brand new. Still pricey, but within the reach of many electronic artists of the day. Unfortunately, the release of the Sequential Circuits Prophet-5, at a mere $2,500, means the CS80 didn't do too well in the end, but it still found itself in the hands of Toto, Vangelis (who swore by it), and the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OWMGAiaNeQ BBC Radiophonics Workshop].

Unfortunately, this document is not yet going to be the be-all-end-all of modeling this synth. The intent of this page is to "get the ball rolling", so to speak, and to serve as a repository on research for Nuclear, as well as to remind us of what kind of goals we're trying to achieve.

Other than the original CS80, there is a software synth that made me believe this was a possible project. It was _not_ the Arturia CS80V. It was, instead, an inexpensive VSTi plug-in made by one man: the [http://www.stillwellaudio.com/?page_id=37 Olga], by Schwa. Just take a listen to the mp3 samples and you'll hear what I mean.
