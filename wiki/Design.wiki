= Introduction =

The Nuclear project consist of three major parts:

 * _SDK_. A C++ framework for creating engines. Can be used on its own to manually develop a engine or in conjunction with code generators. Contain algorithms for handling engine, voices and the processor graph, it also provides common containers for engines (JACK application, DSSI, LV2, VSTi, Audio Unit, RTAS, Python module, etc.).

 * _Code generators_. Generate C++ code from declarations. Nodes for the processor graph are generated using FAUST from DSP files. The processor graph and engine is generated by our own code generator from XML files. The output from the code generators are compiled and linked to the SDK to create a functioning engine.

 * _Editors_. User friendly GUI editor that let you create and edit declarations to be processed by the code generators.

The SDK provides containers and algorithms as a framework for the purpose of creating synth engines. It doesn't make any sound on it's own but take care of all the mind numbing details of dynamic memory allocation and signal routing. 

As long as we get the interface for it right the implementation can be improved and optimized later without breaking anything. A first iteration goal is to design a set of stable and working interfaces, later iterations will deal with improved implementations.

The SDK has three major types:

 * _Engine_. The outermost "shell". This is what you wrap a plugin or application around. Has signal input/outputs and can receive/sends messages. Container for voices, manage voices and mix down all voices for final output.

 * _Voice_. A single instance of the processor graph, the signal path for a voice. Has signal input/outputs and can receive/sends messages. Container for one or more nodes.

 * _Node_. Processor nodes in the graph that can be connected to each other. Has signal input/outputs and can receive/sends messages. A node either directly implement sample generation and modification or act as an adapter for such objects.

There are two types of communications:

 * _Signal_. Sample based data continously flowing through the processing graph. Normally audio data but can also be sample based control signals (so called "CV" data).

 * _Message_. Sparse. Generated by various events. Used for setting parameters, recieve musical data and communication with the GUI.
