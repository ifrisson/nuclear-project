= Formant Filter =

"A formant is a resonance in the voice spectrum. A single formant may thus be modeled using one _biquad_ (second-order filter section). For example, in the vowel /a/ as in 'father,' the first three formant center-frequencies have been measured near 700, 1220, and 2600 Hz, with half-power bandwidths 130, 70, and 160 Hz. In principle, the formant filter sections are in series, as can be found by deriving the transfer function of an acoustic tube. As a consequence, the vocal-tract transfer function is an all-pole filter (provided that the nasal tract is closed off or negligible). As a result, there is no need to specify gains for the formant resonators -- only center-frequency and bandwidth are necessary to specify each formant, leaving only an overall scale factor unspecified in a cascade (series) formant filter bank."
