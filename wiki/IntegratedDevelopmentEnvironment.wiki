= Introduction =

Nuclear include an Integrated Development Environment for coding DSPs with FAUST, designing custom engine GUIs and visually program the processor graph. The IDE will be developed in Python.

We're taking a serious look at using [http://wiki.drobilla.net/FlowCanvas FlowCanvas] as an easy method of drawing a graph-based visual programming GUI.

The IDE comes with a standard library of [BuildingBlockNodes DSP blocks].
